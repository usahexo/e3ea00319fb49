In today’s world, with all of the technological advances, blackjack has made its way to our smart devices as an app. Whether you are in a live casino or playing online, the object of the game is to draw cards totaling 21, or as close to 21 as possible without going over, and beat the dealer. The dealer must draw on 16 and stand on 17.</p>
<p>If you are new to the game, here are a few tips that can help improve your odds:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Know when to hit and when to stand. This takes practice, but if you observe what other players are doing at the table and what the dealer’s upcard is, you will start to develop a strategy that works best for you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Never take insurance. The house edge on insurance is over 14%.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Always split aces and eights. When you split Cards of this rank, you are actually doubling your bet and have two chances to get closer to 21.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be aware of busting. If your card total goes over 21, you automatically lose – no matter what the dealer has.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Master-the-art-of-counting-cards-and-adding-a-soft-hand-to-get-ahead-in-blackjack-NHL"><a href="#Master-the-art-of-counting-cards-and-adding-a-soft-hand-to-get-ahead-in-blackjack-NHL" class="headerlink" title="Master the art of counting cards and adding a soft hand to get ahead in blackjack NHL!"></a>Master the art of counting cards and adding a soft hand to get ahead in blackjack NHL!</h1><p>Blackjack is a casino game that is popular in many parts of the world. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by either getting 21 points on the player’s first two cards or by having the total value of the cards exceed that of the dealer’s without exceeding 21. In order to increase the player’s chances of winning, it is important to understand the basics of the game, including basic strategy and counting cards.</p>
<p>In blackjack, each card has a point value. The ace can be worth 1 or 11, depending on what is needed to make a good hand. The other number cards are worth their face value, and the face cards (king, queen, and jack) are all worth 10 points. When two or more cards are added together, their total value is always equal to the sum of the individual card values. For example, if a player has an ace and a two, their total value is three (1+2=3).</p>
<p>One way to improve the player’s chances of winning at blackjack is to count cards. When players know how many high and low value cards remain in the deck, they can make better decisions about whether to hit or stand. Generally speaking, when there are more high value cards remaining in the deck, it is advantageous for the player to hit; when there are more low value cards remaining in the deck, it is advantageous for the player to stand.</p>
<p>Another thing that players can do in order to increase their chances of winning at blackjack is add a soft hand. A soft hand occurs when one of the player’s first two cards is an ace. When this happens, the ace can be counted as either 1 or 11 points without going over 21. This gives players more options when deciding what move to make during gameplay. For instance, if a player has an ace and a two (making a soft hand), they would normally hit if they had another two as their second card. However, if they were being offered 3:2 odds on their bet (meaning they would get paid out $6 for every $5 bet), then they might want to consider standing instead because their chances of going over 21 are slim if they hit again.</p>
<p>Blackjack can be a fun and exciting game once players understand some of its basic principles. By counting cards and adding a soft hand when playing blackjack, players can give themselves a better chance of winning against opponents at casino tables!</p>

<ul>
<li>Opt for games that offer 4 or more decks. This will give you the best odds.</li>
<li>When the dealer is showing an Ace, always take insurance.</li>
<li>If you have 18 or 19, hit against a dealer’s 3 through 6. Stand against 2 or 7 through 10.</li>
<li>If you have 16, stand against a dealer’s 2 through 9, and hit against a 10 or Ace.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Discover-how-to-easily-beat-the-casino-by-adding-a-soft-hand-to-your-blackjack-game"><a href="#Discover-how-to-easily-beat-the-casino-by-adding-a-soft-hand-to-your-blackjack-game" class="headerlink" title="Discover how to easily beat the casino by adding a soft hand to your blackjack game!"></a>Discover how to easily beat the casino by adding a soft hand to your blackjack game!</h1><p>Casinos want you to think that they have some sort of magical power that allows them to take your money whenever they please. This just isn’t the case! By adding a soft hand to your blackjack game, you can give yourself a much better chance of winning.</p>
<p>When you are playing blackjack, it is important to remember that there are two different types of hands: hard hands and soft hands. A hard hand is any hand where the total number of points is not divisible by 10. For example, if you have a hand with four cards totaling 14 points, this would be considered a hard hand. A soft hand is any hand where the total number of points can be divided by 10. For example, if you have a hand with three cards totaling 7 points, this would be considered a soft hand.</p>
<p>As you probably already know, the goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21 points. This can be done by either getting a higher value than the dealer, or by making the dealer bust (i.e. going over 21 points). When playing with a hard hand, your options are more limited since you cannot Decrease your point total without also losing points. However, when playing with a soft hand, you have more flexibility since you can decrease your point total without actually losing any points. This gives you an advantage over the casino because they are expecting you to play with hard hands only.</p>
<p>One way to take advantage of this is by using basic strategy charts to guide your plays. Generally speaking, you will want to stand on totals of 17 or higher and hit on totals of 16 or lower when playing with a hard hand. However, when playing with a soft hand, these same rules no longer apply! Instead, you will want to stand on totals of 12 or higher and hit on totals of 11 or lower. By following these simple guidelines, you can increase your chances of winning significantly!</p>

<p>In this article, we will discuss some blackjack tips that will help you play like a pro. We will start with basic strategy for those just starting out and then move on to more advanced tactics for those who have some experience under their belts. So whether you’re just getting started or you’re looking to take your game to the next level, keep reading for some helpful tips!</p>
<p>##Basic Strategy##</p>
<p>If you’re just starting out playing blackjack, it’s important to learn the basics first. This includes understanding the different types of hands and how to play each one. Here are the basic steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide how much money you want to bet. </li>
<li>Place your bet by placing chips in the designated area on the table. </li>
<li>The dealer will deal two cards to each player – one face up and one face down. </li>
<li>The dealer will also deal two cards to himself – one face up and one face down. </li>
<li>Turn over your cards and add up the points total. </li>
<li>Based on the total points, decide whether to “stand” (keep your current hand), “hit” (take another card), “double down” (double your original bet), or “split” (split your hand into two separate hands). </li>
<li>If you choose to hit, place another chip beside your first chip in order to indicate that you wish to hit again. </li>
<li>When both players have finished playing their hands, the dealer reveals his hidden card and adds up the points total. </li>
<li>The player either wins or loses based on the final points total.</li>
<li>Collect your winnings or forfeit your bet if you lose.</li>
</ol>
<p>That may all seem a little confusing at first, but don’t worry – we will go over each step in detail below. And once you get the hang of it, Basic Strategy will become second nature! Let’s get started…<br>###Playing Your Hand###</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>First things first: Decide how much money you want to bet</strong> . Blackjack is a game of chance, but that doesn’t mean you have to risk everything on one hand! Start by betting a small amount and see how things go before increasing your stakes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Next: Place your bet</strong> . You can do this by placing chips in the designated area on the table – just be sure to stay within your betting limit!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The dealer will then deal two cards each to all players – one face up and one face down</strong> . At this point, it’s important not to show anyone else at the table what cards you have been dealt!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The dealer will also deal two cards to himself – one face up and one face down</strong> . Remember: He is trying to beat everyone at the table, so he won’t reveal his cards until it’s his turn!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Turn over your cards and add up the points total</strong> . Now is when things start getting interesting…</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Based on the total points, decide what action you want to take</strong> : </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stand</strong> if you’re happy with your current hand (ie., You don’t want any more cards). </li>
<li><strong>Hit</strong> if you would like another card in order to try and improve your hand (remember: You can only hit once per turn). </li>
<li><strong>Double Down</strong> if you would like to double your original bet and receive just one more card (this can only be done when you have two cards totalling 10 or 11 points).   - <strong>Split</strong> if you would like to split your hand into two separate hands (this can only be done when both cards are of equal rank).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>If you choose to hit</strong> , place another chip beside your first chip in order for everyone at the table know that you want another card. When both players have finished playing their hands, it’ll be time for Dealer reveal his hidden card(s)!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>When both players have finished playing their hands</strong> , Dealer reveals his hidden card(s) and adds up all of the points totals together. The player either wins or loses based on this final score – so make sure not too go over 21!</p>
</li>
</ul>
