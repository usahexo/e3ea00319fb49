        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="New-York-Giants-Blowout-Loss-Leads-to-Major-Range-Drop"><a href="#New-York-Giants-Blowout-Loss-Leads-to-Major-Range-Drop" class="headerlink" title="New York Giants Blowout Loss Leads to Major Range Drop"></a>New York Giants Blowout Loss Leads to Major Range Drop</h1><p>The New York Giants suffered an embarrassing 41-13 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night, which has led to a significant range drop for the team.</p>
<p>Prior to the game, the Giants’ playoff odds stood at 55 percent, according to FiveThirtyEight. However, after their lopsided defeat, those odds have fallen to just 19 percent.</p>
<p>What’s more, the Giants’ Super Bowl odds have plummeted from 14 percent to just 4 percent.</p>
<p>This is a major disappointment for fans of the team, who were hoping for a deep playoff run this year. The Giants will now have to win out and get some help from other teams in order to make the postseason.</p>
<p>Obviously, a lot can change in the weeks ahead, but it’s clear that things aren’t looking good for New York right now.</p>
<h1 id="New-York-Giants’-Poor-Play-Results-in-Major-Range-Drop"><a href="#New-York-Giants’-Poor-Play-Results-in-Major-Range-Drop" class="headerlink" title="New York Giants’ Poor Play Results in Major Range Drop"></a>New York Giants’ Poor Play Results in Major Range Drop</h1><p>The New York Giants have been one of the biggest disappointments in the NFL this season. They had high hopes and plenty of preseason hype, but they have not been able to live up to it. After nine games, they have a record of just 3-6.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for their poor play has been their inability to score points. They are averaging just 19.6 points per game, which is 27th in the league. This has led to a number of close losses, as they have only won one game by more than seven points.</p>
<p>A big reason for the low scoring has been the poor play of the offense. The Giants have struggled to move the ball on the ground or through the air. This was especially apparent in their most recent game against the San Francisco 49ers. They were held to just 10 points and 324 total yards.</p>
<p>The Giants’ poor play has also resulted in a major range drop on FanDuel. In Week 1, their average projected score was 27.8 points. This week, that number has fallen all the way down to 18.9 points. This is still enough to be in the top half of teams, but it shows how much they have regressed this season.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a team to fade on FanDuel this week, the Giants should be at the top of your list.</p>
<h1 id="New-York-Giants-Suffer-Significant-Range-Drop-After-Bad-Loss"><a href="#New-York-Giants-Suffer-Significant-Range-Drop-After-Bad-Loss" class="headerlink" title="New York Giants Suffer Significant Range Drop After Bad Loss"></a>New York Giants Suffer Significant Range Drop After Bad Loss</h1><p>The New York Giants had a bad loss against the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday. This was an important game for the Giants, as they were trying to stay in playoff contention. However, they ended up losing by a score of 51-17.</p>
<p>This was an absolutely terrible performance by the Giants. They were completely outplayed by the Rams, who clearly looked like the better team. The Giants’ defense was shredded by Jared Goff and the Rams’ offense, while their own offense was held to just 17 points.</p>
<p>This loss is going to have significant consequences for the Giants. One of the most important is that their odds of making the playoffs have dropped significantly. Prior to this game, they had about a 27% chance of making the playoffs according to FiveThirtyEight. Now, their odds are down to just 6%.</p>
<p>This loss also significantly hurts their chances of winning the NFC East. Before this game, their odds of winning the division were about 48%. Now, those odds have fallen to just 26%.</p>
<p>There are also major questions about whether or not this team is good enough to make a playoff run. This game showed that they are far from being a top team in the NFL. Based on how they performed on Sunday, it’s hard to see them making much noise in the playoffs if they do get there.</p>
<p>All in all, this was a soul-crushing loss for the Giants. It will likely have some significant consequences for their season, both in terms of their playoff chances and their prospects of winning the division.</p>
<h1 id="Range-Drops-Again-for-New-York-Giants-After-Embarrassing-Defeat"><a href="#Range-Drops-Again-for-New-York-Giants-After-Embarrassing-Defeat" class="headerlink" title="Range Drops Again for New York Giants After Embarrassing Defeat"></a>Range Drops Again for New York Giants After Embarrassing Defeat</h1><p>The New York Giants have had a disappointing season, and their latest game was no exception. They lost to the San Francisco 49ers 41-17, dropping their record to 2-10. This was a particularly bad loss, as the 49ers are one of the worst teams in the league.</p>
<p>The Giants’ offense was especially pitiful in this game. They gained only 215 yards of total offense and only 10 first downs. Eli Manning threw 3 interceptions, and the team’s running backs averaged only 2.8 yards per carry. This is by far the worst offensive performance of the season for the Giants.</p>
<p>The defense was not much better. They allowed the 49ers to gain 472 yards of total offense, including 354 passing yards from Jimmy Garoppolo. The Giants also gave up 5 touchdowns on the day. This was by far the worst defensive performance of the season for New York.</p>
<p>It is now clear that the Giants will not make the playoffs this year. They are likely to finish with one of the worst records in the league. It is also looking likely that head coach Ben McAdoo will be fired at the end of the season. This would be a just punishment for McAdoo’s poor job as head coach this year.</p>
<h1 id="New-York-Giants’-Poor-Performance-Causes-Another-Range-Drop"><a href="#New-York-Giants’-Poor-Performance-Causes-Another-Range-Drop" class="headerlink" title="New York Giants’ Poor Performance Causes Another Range Drop"></a>New York Giants’ Poor Performance Causes Another Range Drop</h1><p>The New York Giants have had a rough few weeks. Their poor performance on the field is causing another range drop.</p>
<p>The Giants are now at the bottom of their division, and their chances of making the playoffs are looking increasingly slim.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for their poor play. One issue is that the team has been plagued by injuries. Another problem is that the offensive line has been unable to protect Eli Manning, leading to a lot of sacks.</p>
<p>The team is also having trouble scoring touchdowns. They are averaging just 18 points per game, which is well below league average.</p>
<p>Some fans are calling for head coach Ben McAdoo to be fired. Others are calling for quarterback Eli Manning to be traded.</p>
<p>The Giants have a home game this week against the Kansas City Chiefs. This could be a chance for them to get back on track and start rebuilding their season.</p>
