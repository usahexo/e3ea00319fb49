            </div>

        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="NJ-Officials-Legalized-Sports-Betting-to-Bring-in-500M-in-Revenue"><a href="#NJ-Officials-Legalized-Sports-Betting-to-Bring-in-500M-in-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="NJ Officials: Legalized Sports Betting to Bring in $500M in Revenue"></a>NJ Officials: Legalized Sports Betting to Bring in $500M in Revenue</h1><p>Governor Phil Murphy and state lawmakers from both parties announced that they have agreed on a bill to legalize sports betting in New Jersey, with Governor Murphy predicting the move will generate close to $500 million in revenue over the next fiscal year.</p>
<p>The bill would allow Atlantic City casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting, with the Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport seen as a likely focal point. The state is still waiting for a judgment in its years-long legal battle with major professional sports leagues over the right to offer sports betting.</p>
<p>“It is time to bring this multibillion-dollar industry out of the shadows and into the sunlight, where it can be appropriately monitored and regulated,” said Governor Murphy.</p>
<p>State Senator Paul Sarlo, a Democrat from Wood-Ridge who chairs the Budget and Appropriations Committee, said that taxing sports betting could generate up to $30 million in revenue for the state. He added that the bill contains consumer protections such as requiring those under 21 to receive written permission from a parent or guardian before placing a bet.</p>
<p>Representatives from both parties expressed optimism that the bill would pass despite some last-minute disagreements over details such as how much tax revenue should be earmarked for gambling addiction programs. Some legislators are also pushing for a share of online sports betting revenue to go towards pension payments for retired police and firefighters.</p>
<p>Jeff Gural, operator of Tioga Downs Casino &amp; Resort in Nichols and Vernon Downs Casino &amp; Hotel in Vernon Center, said he expects his facilities to take in $3 million annually once sports betting is legalized. “People have been illegally gambling on sports events for years, so it’s about time it was legalized and brought above board,” he said.</p>
<h1 id="Gaming-Officials-Expect-Billions-in-Sports-Betting-Revenue"><a href="#Gaming-Officials-Expect-Billions-in-Sports-Betting-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Gaming Officials Expect Billions in Sports Betting Revenue"></a>Gaming Officials Expect Billions in Sports Betting Revenue</h1><p>In the United States, sports betting is considered a form of gambling. This means that it is not legal in all 50 states, and that there are regulations in place to help protect consumers. Despite this, some Americans still participate in sports betting, with the total amount wagered on sports each year estimated to be in the billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Gaming officials expect that the legalization of sports betting will cause this number to grow significantly. In fact, some experts are predicting that revenue from sports betting could reach as high as $25 billion annually. This would make it one of the largest revenue streams for the gaming industry.</p>
<p>The potential for such a large windfall has gaming companies clamoring for a piece of the action. A number of them have already expressed interest in setting up shop in states where sports betting is legalized. They see it as an opportunity to bring in new customers and increase profits.</p>
<p>However, not everyone is on board with the idea of legalizing sports betting. Some lawmakers and advocacy groups are concerned about the potential negative effects it could have on society. They worry that it could lead to addiction and financial ruin for many people.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, it appears that legalized sports betting is inevitable. The Supreme Court recently struck down a federal law that banned it, and several states have already started preparations to allow it within their borders. It will likely be some time before it is available nationwide, but when it does come online, it is sure to be a boon for the gaming industry.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Reports-9M-In-Sports-Betting-Revenue"><a href="#Delaware-Reports-9M-In-Sports-Betting-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Reports $9M In Sports Betting Revenue"></a>Delaware Reports $9M In Sports Betting Revenue</h1><p>The Delaware lottery has released its fiscal report for the year and it showed that the state generated nearly $9 million in revenue from sports betting. This was a major increase from the $3 million that was generated in 2018.</p>
<p>The increase can be largely attributed to the legalization of sports betting in the state in June of last year. Since that time, Delaware has become one of the most active states in terms of sports betting, accounting for roughly 5% of all bets placed in the United States.</p>
<p>Delaware’s success is indicative of the overall growth of the industry. According to a recent study by Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming, LLC, sports betting will generate over $4 billion in revenue by 2023. This is a significant increase from the $220 million that was generated in 2018.</p>
<p>The growth of the industry can be attributed to a number of factors, including the increasing acceptance of gambling among Americans and the growing popularity of sports betting. Additionally, many states are now legalizing sports betting, which has created a more competitive environment.</p>
<p>This competition is likely to increase in the coming years as additional states legalize sports betting. This will create opportunities for companies that are able to offer innovative products and services, such as mobile betting and live streaming.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how much longer this rapid growth can continue, but for now, it seems that there is still plenty of upside potential for the industry.</p>
<h1 id="sports-betting-could-bring-in-1-2B-to-New-York-State"><a href="#sports-betting-could-bring-in-1-2B-to-New-York-State" class="headerlink" title="sports betting could bring in $1.2B to New York State"></a>sports betting could bring in $1.2B to New York State</h1><p>If legalized, sports betting could generate between $1.2 billion and $5.5 billion in revenue for New York State over the next 10 years, according to a report released today by the Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>The analysis also found that, if allowed, sports betting would create between 4,000 and 17,000 jobs in New York.</p>
<p>The Gaming Commission’s report comes as state lawmakers consider a bill (A. 9156) that would authorize sports betting in New York. The legislation would allow both commercial and tribal casinos to offer sports betting, and bettors could place wagers on professional and college sporting events. </p>
<p>“This report underscores the tremendous potential of legalized sports betting to generate new economic activity and job growth throughout New York State,” said Gaming Commission Chairman Kevin Law. “We encourage the Legislature to pass this important legislation and give New Yorkers the opportunity to bet on their favorite teams.”</p>
<p>New York is one of several states considering legalization of sports betting in the wake of a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision clearing the way for such activity.</p>
<h1 id="Rhode-Island-Could-See-23M-In-Annual-Sports-Betting-Revenue"><a href="#Rhode-Island-Could-See-23M-In-Annual-Sports-Betting-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Rhode Island Could See $23M In Annual Sports Betting Revenue"></a>Rhode Island Could See $23M In Annual Sports Betting Revenue</h1><p>Rhode Island is one of the handful of states that has already legalized sports betting, and analysts are projecting that the state could see up to $23 million in annual revenue from the activity. This would make Rhode Island the second-largest beneficiary of sports betting in the country, after Nevada.</p>
<p>The news comes as other states are moving to legalize sports betting in the wake of a Supreme Court decision last year that struck down a federal prohibition on the activity. Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, and West Virginia have all legalized sports betting since then, and several other states are considering similar measures.</p>
<p>Rhode Island’s $23 million projection is based on an estimate that each resident will wager about $290 a year on sports betting. That figure is higher than in most other states, but it still represents a significant potential source of revenue for Rhode Island.</p>
<p>The state is expected to collect taxes on sports betting revenue at a rate of 15%, which would amount to about $3.5 million in annual tax revenue. In addition, the state will receive payments from casinos for their rights to offer sports betting.</p>
<p>Analysts believe that Rhode Island’s legal sports betting market could eventually be worth more than $320 million per year. That would make it one of the largest such markets in the country.</p>
