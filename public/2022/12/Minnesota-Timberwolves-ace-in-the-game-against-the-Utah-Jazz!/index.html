      		<h1 id="Minnesota-Timberwolves-ace-in-the-game-against-the-Utah-Jazz"><a href="#Minnesota-Timberwolves-ace-in-the-game-against-the-Utah-Jazz" class="headerlink" title="Minnesota Timberwolves ace in the game against the Utah Jazz!"></a>Minnesota Timberwolves ace in the game against the Utah Jazz!</h1><p>The Minnesota Timberwolves wrote another victory in the book against the Utah Jazz 118-108. Karl Anthony Towns led Timberwolves with 31 points and 12 rebounds, Jimmy Butler has contributed 20 points. In the fourth, Utah was only able to score 14 points. Ricky Rubio has added 14 assists for Minnesota, which is one shy of his career high.</p>
<p>This game was all about Towns and Wiggins.Andrew Wiggins also scored 31 points with five rebounds and four assists, shot 50 percent from the field and made 5-of-11 three pointers. Jeff Teague chipped in 10 points, six assists and five rebounds off the bench for Minnesota).</p>
<p>Rudy Gobert led Utah with 22 points and 15 rebounds; Joe Ingles had 17 points. Derrick Favors contributed 14 points and eight rebounds before fouling out late in the fourth quarter. Donovan Mitchell missed all nine of his shots and ended up with just two points.#</p>
<p>The Jazz are a good defensive team, but they had no answer for KAT or Wiggins tonight. This may have been Towns’ best game of the season so far. He was unstoppable on both ends of the floor, scoring inside and outside, and grabbing lots of rebounds. Wiggins was also very impressive, hitting some difficult shots in the fourth quarter to seal the win for Minnesota.</p>
<h1 id="Zach-LaVine-The-Minnesota-Timberwolves-Ace"><a href="#Zach-LaVine-The-Minnesota-Timberwolves-Ace" class="headerlink" title="Zach LaVine: The Minnesota Timberwolves Ace!"></a>Zach LaVine: The Minnesota Timberwolves Ace!</h1><p>Zach LaVine is a player for the Minnesota Timberwolves. He was drafted with the 13th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft. LaVine played college basketball at UCLA.</p>
<p>LaVine’s rookie season was cut short by a torn ACL, which he suffered in February 2016. He made his return to the court in late November 2016.</p>
<p>In his first full season back from injury, LaVine averaged 18.9 points per game, 3.4 rebounds per game and 3.0 assists per game. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team for the 2017–18 season.</p>
<p>LaVine is a major part of the Timberwolves’ future and is quickly becoming one of the NBA’s most exciting players to watch.</p>
<h1 id="Andrew-Wiggins-Is-A-Minnesota-Timberwolves-Ace"><a href="#Andrew-Wiggins-Is-A-Minnesota-Timberwolves-Ace" class="headerlink" title="Andrew Wiggins Is A Minnesota Timberwolves Ace!"></a>Andrew Wiggins Is A Minnesota Timberwolves Ace!</h1><p>In his first full season as a Minnesota Timberwolves, Andrew Wiggins proved himself to be an ace player. Wiggins was drafted first overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2014 NBA draft but was traded to the Timberwolves on August 23, 2014, as part of a three-team trade that also involved the Philadelphia 76ers.</p>
<p>Wiggins began the season as the starting small forward and averaged 19.7 points per game on 45.6% shooting from the field and 34.1% shooting from three-point range. On April 11, 2017, he was named NBA Rookie of the Year, becoming only the second Canadian after Anthony Bennett to win the award. He was also named to the NBA All-Rookie Team.</p>
<p>Wiggins had some big games during his rookie year. On November 12, 2016, he scored 33 points against the Oklahoma City Thunder. On December 3, 2016, he had a career-high 38 points against the New Orleans Pelicans. On January 8, 2017, he scored 37 points against the Houston Rockets. On February 6, 2017, he recorded his first triple double with 26 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a victory over the Denver Nuggets.</p>
<p>Wiggins showed improvement as a sophomore player during the 2017–18 season. He increased his scoring average to 23.6 points per game while still shooting efficiently from both inside and outside of the arc. He was also selected to represent Team USA at the FIBA World Cup where he averaged 18 points per game and earned MVP honors for helping lead Team USA to a gold medal finish.</p>
<h1 id="Karl-Anthony-Towns-An-Ace-for-the-Minnesota-Timberwolves"><a href="#Karl-Anthony-Towns-An-Ace-for-the-Minnesota-Timberwolves" class="headerlink" title="Karl-Anthony Towns: An Ace for the Minnesota Timberwolves!"></a>Karl-Anthony Towns: An Ace for the Minnesota Timberwolves!</h1><p>The Minnesota Timberwolves have not had it easy over the last few years. After trading away Kevin Love, they have been in rebuilding mode for a while now. And, as most rebuilding teams go, the Timberwolves have not made the playoffs since 2004. There has been some hope recently with emerging stars Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins, but things were not looking good for the Timberwolves this past season. Wiggins was playing like a one-dimensional scorer and Towns was struggling with his defense.</p>
<p>However, this past season seems to be turning around for the better. With Wiggins becoming more well-rounded and Towns’ defense improving, the Timberwolves are in a much better position than they were last year. In particular, Karl-Anthony Towns has been playing extremely well lately. This is most evident in his performances against two of the best teams in the NBA: the Golden State Warriors and the Houston Rockets.</p>
<p>In Minnesota’s January 24th game against the Warriors, Towns scored 36 points and grabbed 18 rebounds. And on March 10th, when the Timberwolves played the Rockets, Towns had 31 points and 14 rebounds. Clearly, he has what it takes to compete with some of the best players in the NBA.</p>
<p>So what makes Karl-Anthony Towns so good? Well, he has an incredibly versatile offensive game. He can shoot from anywhere on the court and score in a variety of ways. He is also an excellent rebounder, both offensively and defensively. In addition to all of that, he is still young and has plenty of room to improve his game.</p>
<p>The future looks bright for both Karl-Anthony Towns and the Minnesota Timberwolves. With Wiggins continuing to develop into a top player and Towns stepping up his game even more, they could very well make it to the playoffs this year. And if they keep improving at this rate, they could become one of the strongest teams in the NBA in no time!</p>
<h1 id="Tyus-Jones-Proving-Himself-as-a-Minnesota-Timberwolves-Ace"><a href="#Tyus-Jones-Proving-Himself-as-a-Minnesota-Timberwolves-Ace" class="headerlink" title="Tyus Jones Proving Himself as a Minnesota Timberwolves Ace"></a>Tyus Jones Proving Himself as a Minnesota Timberwolves Ace</h1><p>Just one year ago, the Minnesota Timberwolves were a young, up-and-coming team with plenty of promise. That promise has mostly been realized in 2017-18, as the Wolves currently sit in 4th place in the Western Conference with a record of 36-25. Much of this success can be attributed to the play of their star player, Andrew Wiggins, and their rising stars Karl-Anthony Towns and Jimmy Butler.</p>
<p>However, another key factor in the Wolves’ success this season has been Tyus Jones. The 21-year-old point guard has proven himself as a reliable starter for the Wolves, averaging 7.8 points and 5.1 assists per game while shooting an impressive 38.9 percent from three-point range. Jones’s playmaking ability and three-point shooting have been especially valuable for the Wolves this season, as they often struggle to score when Towns and Wiggins are not on the court.</p>
<p>Jones’s emergence as a key player for the Timberwolves has come as a bit of a surprise to many observers. After all, he was drafted by Minnesota barely two years ago with the 24th overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft. At that time, he was seen mainly as a backup point guard who could provide some relief for veteran Ricky Rubio.</p>
<p>However, Rubio was traded by the Wolves before the start of last season, and Jones was given an opportunity to start at point guard. He took full advantage of that opportunity, averaging 9.5 points and 5.6 assists per game while shooting an impressive 41 percent from three-point range. This performance earned him a spot on the NBA All-Rookie Second Team last season.</p>
<p>This season, Jones has continued to play well for the Timberwolves, even as they added Butler in a trade last November. In fact, Jones’s play may have been even more important after Butler was injured at the end of January. With Butler sidelined for most of February and March, Jones averaged 11 points and 6 assists per game while shooting an impressive 45 percent from three-point range.</p>
<p>Now that Butler is back healthy, Jones will likely return to his role as backup point guard. However, his strong play this season has shown that he is capable of being a starter for a good NBA team. The Timberwolves are certainly one of those teams; thanks in large part to Tyus Jones’s emergence as an ace player</p>
