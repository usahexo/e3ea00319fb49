<p>Let’s take a closer look at the top 10 highest-paid NHL players for 2018.</p>
<p>#10: Alex Ovechkin, Forward, Washington Capitals – $9.5 Million<br>All-Star forward Alex Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals earns $9.5 million per year, good for tenth on the list of richest NHL players. The 33-year-old Russian has spent his entire 14-year career with Washington and is considered one of the greatest players of all time.

<p>#9: Carey Price, Goaltender, Montreal Canadiens – $10 Million<br>Montreal Canadiens goaltender Carey Price earns $10 million per year, making him the ninth highest-paid player in the NHL.

<p>#6: Jamie Benn, Forward, Dallas Stars – $12 Million<br>Jamie Benn of the Dallas Stars earns $12 million per year, putting him at number six on this year’s list of richest NHL players.

<p>#5: Jonathan Toews, Forward; Chicago Blackhawks – $13 Million </p>
<p>Jonathan Toews is captain of both his hometown Chicago Blackhawks team and Team Canada - he’s also making some serious cash off both teams too! He pulls down an annual salary of $13M from Chicago - 5th most among all NHLers - thanks to an 8 year extension signed back in 2013 totaling 104M$. That contract makes him one game away from becoming only 1st U$ captain to hit 1B$ (in bonuses) during their careers - quite impressive! Add on another 3M$ from Team Canada plus various bonuses etc., Toews easily clears 12M$ each season which lands him comfortably at 5th overall on this particular list!</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Money-Does-an-NHL-Player-Make-Per-Year"><a href="#How-Much-Money-Does-an-NHL-Player-Make-Per-Year" class="headerlink" title="How Much Money Does an NHL Player Make Per Year?"></a>How Much Money Does an NHL Player Make Per Year?</h1><p>An NHL player’s salary can vary greatly depending on their experience and role on the team. The average NHL salary was $2.9 million in the 2016-2017 season, but players at the top of the pay scale can make up to $14 million a year.</p>
<p>In the 2016-2017 season, the 10 highest paid NHL players earned a combined $156.7 million in salary. This means that the average salary for an NHL player in the 2016-2017 season was $2.9 million, but the median salary was much lower at $1 million.</p>
<p>The league minimum for an NHL player is $650,000 per year, and most players earn around $3 million per year. Players in the middle of the pay scale can make around $7 million per year, while the highest paid players in the league can make up to $14 million per year.</p>
<p>Most NHL teams use a salary cap to limit how much they can spend on player salaries. The current salary cap for the NHL is set at $75 million, which means that no team can exceed this amount when signing players. This cap helps to ensure that teams with less money are able to compete with teams that have more money.</p>
<p>NHL rookie contracts are typically four years long and worth between $1 and $4 million per year. Veteran contracts are typically three or four years long and worth more money per year than rookie contracts. Many players also sign bonuses as part of their contracts, which are paid out either annually or when certain goals are met.</p>
<p>Players’ salaries are often renegotiated after they have finished their rookie contract or played a certain number of years in the league. This allows teams to keep their top players while also ensuring that they don’t go over the salary cap.</p>
<p>The current highest paid player in the NHL is Connor McDavid of the Edmonton Oilers, who is earning an annual salary of $12.5 million as part of a eight-year contract he signed in July 2017.</p>
