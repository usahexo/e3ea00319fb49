      		<h1 id="Indian-Tribe-Fights-for-Bay-Mills-Casino-Ownership"><a href="#Indian-Tribe-Fights-for-Bay-Mills-Casino-Ownership" class="headerlink" title="Indian Tribe Fights for Bay Mills Casino Ownership"></a>Indian Tribe Fights for Bay Mills Casino Ownership</h1><p>The Bay Mills Indian Tribe is in a legal dispute with the state of Michigan over the tribe’s ownership of a casino. The tribe says the casino was built on land that was ceded to them in an 1836 treaty, but the state claims the casino was built illegally and should be shut down.</p>
<p>The dispute began in December 2014, when the state filed a lawsuit against the tribe, seeking to shut down the casino. The state argued that the tribe does not have the right to operate a casino because the land on which it is located was ceded to Michigan in an 1836 treaty, not to the tribe. The tribe responded by filing a countersuit in federal court, arguing that the casino was built on land that was ceded to them in that treaty.</p>
<p>In November 2015, a federal judge ruled in favor of the state, ordering the tribe to shut down the casino. However, the tribe appealed that ruling and, in March 2016, a federal appeals court reversed the decision and ruled in favor of the tribe. The state has since asked for a review by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The dispute over ownership of Bay Mills Casino has been ongoing for more than two years and shows no signs of being resolved anytime soon. In addition to costing both sides millions of dollars in legal fees, it has also resulted in layoffs at Bay Mills Casino. The vast majority of employees at the casino are members of either the Bay Mills Indian Tribe or one of its affiliates, so they have been directly impacted by this dispute.</p>
<p>Regardless of who ultimately wins this legal battle, it is clear that tribal members will be among those who suffer most from it.</p>
<h1 id="Michigan-Tribe-Claims-Ownership-of-Bay-Mills-Casino"><a href="#Michigan-Tribe-Claims-Ownership-of-Bay-Mills-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Michigan Tribe Claims Ownership of Bay Mills Casino"></a>Michigan Tribe Claims Ownership of Bay Mills Casino</h1><p>A Native American tribe in Michigan has filed a lawsuit against the owners of the Bay Mills Casino, claiming the tribe owns the property.</p>
<p>The Grand Rapids Press reports that the Match-E-Be-Nash- She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians, also known as the Gun Lake Tribe, has filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to have the casino closed. In the lawsuit, the tribe claims it never relinquished ownership of the property, which it deeded to the Ottawa County Gaming Authority in 2002.</p>
<p>The Ottawa County Gaming Authority operates the Bay Mills Casino. The tribal chairman, D.K. Sprague, says the tribe has been trying to negotiate a settlement with the authority for two years, but those efforts have failed.</p>
<p>“We’ve been more than patient in trying to get this matter resolved through negotiations,” Sprague said in a statement. “Unfortunately, our attempts have not born fruit and this is now our last resort.”</p>
<p>The Ottawa County Gaming Authority has not yet commented on the lawsuit.</p>
<h1 id="Judge-rules-in-favor-of-tribe-in-ownership-battle-of-Bay-Mills-casino"><a href="#Judge-rules-in-favor-of-tribe-in-ownership-battle-of-Bay-Mills-casino" class="headerlink" title="Judge rules in favor of tribe in ownership battle of Bay Mills casino"></a>Judge rules in favor of tribe in ownership battle of Bay Mills casino</h1><p>The Casino of Bay Mills Indian Community will continue to be owned and operated by the tribe, a federal judge ruled Monday.</p>
<p>The ruling is the latest development in a more than two-year ownership battle between the tribe and former business partner William Gogek.</p>
<p>Gogek, who owns the nearby Kewadin casino, alleged that the tribe had broken an agreement to give him exclusive rights to operate a casino in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Paul Borman ruled that the tribe was within its rights to open the casino, which it has operated since 2010.</p>
<p>“This is a victory for tribal sovereignty,” Tribal Chairman Bryan Rice said in a statement. “It is also a victory for all tribes across the country who are seeking to exercise their inherent rights as governments.”</p>
<p>Gogek said he would appeal the decision.</p>
<h1 id="Michigan-tribe-wrests-control-of-Bay-Mills-casino-from-tribe-in-Ontario"><a href="#Michigan-tribe-wrests-control-of-Bay-Mills-casino-from-tribe-in-Ontario" class="headerlink" title="Michigan tribe wrests control of Bay Mills casino from tribe in Ontario"></a>Michigan tribe wrests control of Bay Mills casino from tribe in Ontario</h1><p>The Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians in Michigan has wrested control of the Bay Mills casino from a tribe in Ontario, Canada, according to a statement released by the Michigan tribe.</p>
<p>The Bay Mills Indian Casino, which is located in Brimley, Michigan, is on the border of the two countries. The casino is operated by the Bay Mills Indian Community, a federally recognized tribe in Ontario.</p>
<p>The Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians said that it has taken control of the casino “in order to protect the interests” of its members and to enforce Michigan’s tribal gaming compact with the state.</p>
<p>“It is our intent to operate the casino in a manner that is compliant with Michigan law and our tribal gaming compact,” said Chairman Aaron Payment in the statement. “We are committed to working with state and federal officials to ensure that all aspects of our operation are lawful.”</p>
<p>The Ontario tribe said it was “disappointed” by the move and accused the Michigan tribe of using “misinformation and scare tactics” in its dealings with the Canadian tribe.</p>
<p>“Our primary concern remains with our membership and we are doing everything we can to ensure their well-being,” said Chief Randall Phillips in a statement.</p>
<p>The Canadian tribe also said it would “pursue all legal options available to us” to regain control of the casino.</p>
<h1 id="Battle-for-control-of-Bay-Mills-casino-continues"><a href="#Battle-for-control-of-Bay-Mills-casino-continues" class="headerlink" title="Battle for control of Bay Mills casino continues"></a>Battle for control of Bay Mills casino continues</h1><p>The Bay Mills Indian Casino in Brimley, Michigan has been the center of a battle for control between the tribe’s chairman and tribal council for the past several months. </p>
<p>The casino is owned by the Bay Mills Indian Tribe, a federally recognized tribe with over 2,000 members. The tribe’s chairman, William Anoatubby, has been in control of the casino since it opened in 1992. </p>
<p>However, the tribal council has been trying to wrest control from Anoatubby, claiming that he has been running the casino into the ground. The tribal council has accused Anoatubby of financial mismanagement, including awarding no-bid contracts to friends and family members. They have also claimed that Anoatubby has failed to invest in the casino’s future, choosing instead to use its profits to fund his own lavish lifestyle. </p>
<p>Anoatubby has denied all of the allegations and claims that the tribal council is just trying to take control of the casino for their own benefit. He notes that under his leadership, the casino has continued to be profitable and generate jobs and economic opportunities for the tribe members. </p>
<p>The battle for control of Bay Mills casino continues as neither side shows any sign of backing down.</p>
