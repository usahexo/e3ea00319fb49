            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Gambling-Winnings-to-Qualify-for-Review-of-NHL-Increased-to-10-000"><a href="#Gambling-Winnings-to-Qualify-for-Review-of-NHL-Increased-to-10-000" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Winnings to Qualify for Review of NHL Increased to $10,000"></a>Gambling Winnings to Qualify for Review of NHL Increased to $10,000</h1><p>Beginning this season, gambling winnings in the National Hockey League will have to be at least $10,000 for a team owner or senior executive to trigger a review of the club under NHL rules.</p>
<p>The change in policy was made in order to “provide some level of assurance that club owners and senior executives are held to the same standard as players and team employees with respect to gambling activity,” according to NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly.</p>
<p>“NHL clubs are not permitted to gamble on hockey,” Daly said in an email to The Associated Press. “That includes casino gaming, wagering on hockey games or any other sporting events, and betting on fantasy sports.”</p>
<p>The $10,000 threshold is significantly higher than the previous limit of $500. That amount was set in 1992 and had not been changed until now.</p>
<p>While team owners and executives are not allowed to gamble on professional hockey games, they are allowed to gamble on other sporting events. The NHL has no rule against owning a stake in a casino, which some team owners do.</p>
<p>The new policy was announced shortly after it was revealed that Calgary Flames co-owner Murray Edwards had his stake in PokerStars reduced by 50 percent due to changes in Canadian gambling laws. Edwards is still allowed to own the other half of the company and remains on the board of directors.</p>
<h1 id="NHL-Referees-to-Review-Gambling-Winnings-on-All-Games"><a href="#NHL-Referees-to-Review-Gambling-Winnings-on-All-Games" class="headerlink" title="NHL Referees to Review Gambling Winnings on All Games"></a>NHL Referees to Review Gambling Winnings on All Games</h1><p>NHL referees will review gambling winnings on all games as part of the league’s integrity policy, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman announced on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“This is a step we’re taking to ensure the integrity of our game,” Bettman said. “We want to make sure that our fans know that the games are being officiated fairly.”</p>
<p>The new policy will require referees to report any gambling winnings to the league office, and any referee who bets on NHL games will be subject to disciplinary action.</p>
<p>“This is just another step in our efforts to protect the integrity of the game,” Bettman said. “We’re always looking for ways to improve our policies and procedures, and this is one of those steps.”</p>
<h1 id="Bettors-with-Gambling-Winnings-over-1-000-to-be-Banned-from-NHL-Games"><a href="#Bettors-with-Gambling-Winnings-over-1-000-to-be-Banned-from-NHL-Games" class="headerlink" title="Bettors with Gambling Winnings over $1,000 to be Banned from NHL Games"></a>Bettors with Gambling Winnings over $1,000 to be Banned from NHL Games</h1><p>The National Hockey League (NHL) announced on Monday that it will be implementing a new policy that will ban bettors with gambling winnings over $1,000 from attending NHL games.</p>
<p>“This new policy is aimed at protecting the integrity of our game and ensuring that our fans have a positive experience when attending an NHL game,” said NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman in a statement released on Monday.</p>
<p>Bettman added that the league consulted with both the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Football League (NFL) in developing this new policy.</p>
<p>Under the new policy, any fan who has won more than $1,000 betting on NHL games will not be allowed to attend any future games. The policy will also apply to anyone who has been convicted of a crime related to gambling.</p>
<p>The NHL is the latest sports league to tighten its rules around sports betting. In May, the NBA announced that it would be prohibiting anyone who has placed a bet on NBA games from entering its arenas. The NFL also prohibits anyone who has placed a bet on NFL games from entering its stadiums.</p>
<h1 id="Increased-Scrutiny-for-Gambling-Winnings-at-NHL-Games"><a href="#Increased-Scrutiny-for-Gambling-Winnings-at-NHL-Games" class="headerlink" title="Increased Scrutiny for Gambling Winnings at NHL Games"></a>Increased Scrutiny for Gambling Winnings at NHL Games</h1><p>The National Hockey League (NHL) is no stranger to scrutiny, but a recent report is raising new concerns about the way the league handles gambling winnings. According to a story in The Athletic, an NHL franchise owner has been accused of using his team to funnel money into illegal gambling activities.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the NHL has been under fire for its relationship with gambling. In 2013, then-NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly testified before a U.S. Senate committee that the league was in favor of legalized sports betting. This position put the NHL at odds with other major professional sports leagues in the United States, which have lobbied hard against any expansion of legalized sports betting.</p>
<p>Critics argue that the NHL’s stance on gambling creates a conflict of interest for teams and players. Any involvement with gambling can open the door for potential corruption and match-fixing. This was highlighted in 2015 when several players on the Ottawa Senators were caught up in a cheating scandal that involved gambling on poker games.</p>
<p>In light of these recent allegations, there is growing pressure on the NHL to take a harder line on gambling activity by its teams and players. Some are calling for tougher penalties for anyone caught involved in illegal gambling, while others are calling for an outright ban on all forms of gambling involvement by NHL personnel.</p>
<p>So far, the NHL has declined to comment on the matter. However, it is clear that the league is facing increasing pressure to address its ties to gambling. As more and more states legalize sports betting, the NHL will come under greater scrutiny to ensure that its games are being played fair and square.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Winnings-Now-Necessary-to-Trigger-Review-of-NHL"><a href="#Gambling-Winnings-Now-Necessary-to-Trigger-Review-of-NHL" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Winnings Now Necessary to Trigger Review of NHL"></a>Gambling Winnings Now Necessary to Trigger Review of NHL</h1><p>The NHL’s Board of Governors has amended the league’s constitution to require gambling winnings to trigger a review of a player’s contract. The amendment, which was unanimously approved, comes in the wake of the revelation that Ottawa Senators assistant general manager Randy Lee had been charged with misdemeanor harassment in May.</p>
<p>According to the amendment, if a player or front office employee is convicted of a crime “related to illegal gambling”, their contract will be subject to review by the Board of Governors. The league stressed that the amendment is not specifically targeted at any individual or team, but is instead meant as a measure to protect the integrity of the NHL.</p>
<p>This amendment comes as the latest in a series of scandals involving players and gambling. In March, Calgary Flames coach Glen Gulutzan was fired after it was revealed that he had been betting on hockey games. The previous season, then-Dallas Stars forward Jaromir Jagr was fined for betting on games played by his own team.</p>
<p>The NHL has long sought to distance itself from gambling, which it considers a potential threat to the integrity of its games. In 2005, then-NHL commissioner Gary Bettman testified before Congress in favour of banning internet gambling. At the time, Bettman warned that “If you can’t legislate integrity, you lose your sport.”</p>
<p>While there is no evidence that any recent scandals have impacted the outcome of games, they have nonetheless damaged the image of the NHL. The new amendment is an attempt by the league to demonstrate that it takes player conduct seriously and is willing to take measures to protect its integrity.</p>
