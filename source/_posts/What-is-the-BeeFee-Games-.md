#  What is the BeeFee Games? 

BeeFee Games Ltd. is a mobile game development studio located in Auckland, New Zealand. The company was founded in 2014 by brothers Api and Pheroze Patel. BeeFee is best known for its award-winning puzzle game, Quell Reflect, which was released in late 2016.

Api and Pheroze grew up making video games together in their parents' garage. They started BeeFee as a way to share their passion for game development with the world. Since then, the company has grown from a two-man team to a seven-person team of developers, artists, and producers.

BeeFee's first game was called Quell Memento. It was released in late 2014 and was well-received by critics and gamers alike. Quell Memento was followed up by Quell Reflect in late 2016. Reflect was even more successful than its predecessor, receiving several awards and nominations including "Best Mobile Game" at the 2017 New Zealand Game Awards ceremony.

 BeeFee is currently working on several new projects which will be announced in due course.
