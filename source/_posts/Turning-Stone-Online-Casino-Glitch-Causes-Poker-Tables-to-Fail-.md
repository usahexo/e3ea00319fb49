#  Turning Stone Online Casino Glitch Causes Poker Tables to Fail 

Last night, players at the Turning Stone Online Casino were met with an unexpected issue – the poker tables failed to load. The glitch caused a widespread problem that impacted multiple games, leaving players unable to join or finish their games.

The casino’s technical team was quick to address the issue, identifying the root of the problem and working to correct it. Unfortunately, by the time they were able to get the tables up and running again, many players had already left in frustration.

In a statement released this morning, Turning Stone Online Casino apologized for the inconvenience and offered players a special promotion as compensation. Those who played during the downtime are eligible to receive 10% of their total losses back as a casino bonus.

This is not the first time that online casinos have faced technical difficulties. In fact, glitches and outages are becoming increasingly common as casinos transition from desktop-based platforms to ones that are completely web-based.

Fortunately, most casinos have learned from past mistakes and have put in place contingency plans that help them manage these types of situations more effectively. In most cases, players are able to continue playing without interruption, although they may experience some delays in loading times.

As online casinos continue to grow in popularity, we can expect to see more of these types of glitches and outages. However, with proper planning and execution, casinos should be able to minimize their impact on players.

#  Turning Stone Casino Suffers Major Glitch, All Poker Tables Down 

The Turning Stone Casino in Verona, New York suffered a major glitch on Saturday night, causing all of its poker tables to go down.

The outage began at around 10:00 pm and continued until around 3:00 am on Sunday morning. During that time, players were unable to access any of the casino's poker tables.

In a statement released on Sunday, the casino said that it was still investigating the cause of the outage and that it would be providing further updates as they become available.

This is not the first time that the Turning Stone Casino has had problems with its poker tables. In February of this year, the casino's online poker room went down for several hours.

Players were understandably frustrated by this latest outage. "It's really annoying when something like this happens," said one player. "I was really looking forward to playing some poker tonight and now I'm stuck here at the casino with nothing to do."

Others were more philosophical about the whole thing. "These things happen," said another player. "It's just unfortunate that it happened on a weekend when there are so many people here."

A message on the casino's website read: "We are currently experiencing technical difficulties with our online poker software. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and we are working diligently to resolve the issue as soon as possible."
