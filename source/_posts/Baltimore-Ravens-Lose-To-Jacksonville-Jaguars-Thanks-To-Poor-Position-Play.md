#  Baltimore Ravens Lose To Jacksonville Jaguars Thanks To Poor Position Play

In a stunning turn of events, the Baltimore Ravens lost to the Jacksonville Jaguars Sunday. This was largely thanks to poor positioning by the Ravens defense, which allowed the Jaguars to march up and down the field at will.

The Ravens put up a strong fight in the first half, scoring 14 points while holding the Jaguars scoreless. However, in the second half things went downhill fast. The Jaguars scored 21 points while the Ravens could only muster 3.

This loss is particularly frustrating because it feels like a missed opportunity. The Ravens had been playing well lately and were looking like a contender in the AFC. With this loss they have likely squandered any chance at making the playoffs this year.

All is not lost, however. The Ravens still have a chance to salvage their season if they can beat the Cincinnati Bengals in their next game. A win there would put them right back in the playoff race.

#  Ravens Offense Falls Apart In Second Half, Can't Overcome Poor Positioning

In their preseason finale against the Atlanta Falcons on Thursday night, the Ravens offense looked very dismal in the second half. Joe Flacco and company were only able to muster 10 points after halftime and ended up losing, 23-17.

While it is just the preseason, this game served as a stark reminder that if the Ravens offense falls behind early, they may be in trouble.

This was evident right out of the gate. The Falcons marched down the field on their opening drive and scored a touchdown. The Ravens offense then went three-and-out and failed to convert on fourth down.

Baltimore would finally get on the scoreboard late in the first quarter with a Justin Tucker field goal. However, they again went three-and-out on their next possession.

The second quarter was more of the same for Baltimore. They were only able to muster two more points off two Tucker field goals, as they continued to struggle moving the ball downfield.

In fact, their longest play from scrimmage was only 21 yards. This lack of a big play ability was really hurt them in the end as they were unable to keep up with Atlanta's scoring pace.

There are certainly some positives that can be taken away from this game. The biggest being that Baltimore's defense played fairly well, especially in the second half. They were able to get pressure on Matt Ryan and force some turnovers.

However, these defensive efforts will be for naught if Baltimore can't figure out their offensive woes quickly. If they can't find a way to score more points in future games, they could easily find themselves at the bottom of the AFC North division standings.

#  Flacco Shines, Offense Struggles In Baltimore Ravens' Loss To Cincinnati Bengals

The Baltimore Ravens suffered a tough 20-0 loss to AFC North rivals the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday. While Joe Flacco had an impressive day passing for 376 yards, the Ravens' offense as a whole struggles immensely, failing to score a single touchdown.

Flacco was able to take advantage of the Bengals' weak secondary, completing 35 of 47 passes for 376 yards and an interception. However, the running game was non-existent, with Alex Collins only able to muster up 40 yards on 16 carries. The Ravens' wide receivers also failed to make much of an impact, with John Brown and Michael Crabtree both finishing with less than 50 yards receiving.

On the other side of the ball, the Bengals were led by their star rookie quarterback Andy Dalton. He completed 21 of 28 passes for 243 yards and two touchdowns. Giovani Bernard was also impressive on the ground, rushing for 66 yards on 14 carries. AJ Green led Cincinnati's receivers with six catches for 91 yards and a touchdown.

The Ravens will look to get back on track next week when they travel to Charlotte to take on the Panthers.

#  Denver Broncos Take Advantage Of Baltimore Ravens' Poor Positional Play

The Denver Broncos were able to take advantage of Baltimore Ravens' poor positional play and win 26-9. Baltimore's linebackers were consistently burned by the Denver Broncos' TEs and RBs in the passing game, leading to big plays for the Broncos. Additionally, the Ravens' secondary was unable to keep up with the Broncos' receivers, allowing QB Trevor Siemian to have a big day through the air. The Ravens will need to make some adjustments if they hope to compete with better teams in the future.

#  Detroit Lions Use Solid Fundamentals To Beat Baltimore Ravens

Coming into the game, the Detroit Lions knew that they had to play a solid game in order to come out with a victory against the Baltimore Ravens. They did just that.

The Lions started the game off with a scoring drive. They were helped by a 46-yard run by Kerryon Johnson. The drive culminated in a touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford to Marvin Jones Jr.

After that, it was all Baltimore. The Ravens scored 17 unanswered points to take a 17-7 lead into halftime.

In the second half, the Lions came back determined. They scored touchdowns on their first two drives of the half to take a 21-17 lead.

Baltimore answered with a field goal to make it 21-20, but that would be as close as they would get. The Lions added two more touchdowns to seal the victory.

Stafford had an impressive game, throwing for 292 yards and four touchdowns. Johnson also had a big game, rushing for 105 yards on 18 carries.

This was an important win for the Lions, who are now 2-3 on the season. They will look to build on this win as they go forward in their quest for the playoffs.
