# How to Know When a Video Slot Machine is Ready to Hit - 888 Casino

Video slot machines are some of the most popular games in any casino, and many players are always looking for ways to increase their chances of winning. One question that often comes up is how to know when a video slot machine is ready to hit. In this article, we'll explore some tips and strategies for identifying when a video slot machine is ready to pay out on 888 Casino.

## Understanding Random Number Generators (RNGs)

Before we dive into how to know when a video slot machine is ready to hit, it's important to understand how these machines work. Video slot machines use a Random Number Generator (RNG) to determine the outcome of each spin. The RNG ensures that each spin is completely random and independent of the previous spins. This means that there is no way to predict when a machine will hit the jackpot or pay out a big win.

## Look for Signs of Recent Payouts

One way to get an idea of when a video slot machine is ready to hit is to look for signs of recent payouts. For example, if a machine has recently paid out a large jackpot, it may be less likely to pay out again in the near future. Conversely, if a machine hasn't paid out in a while, it may be more likely to hit soon.

## Consider the Volatility of the Machine

Another factor to consider is the volatility of the machine. High-volatility machines tend to pay out larger wins less frequently, while low-volatility machines pay out smaller wins more often. If you're looking for a big win, a high-volatility machine may be a better option, but be prepared to lose more in the short-term. Conversely, if you're looking to play for a longer period of time and win more small payouts, a low-volatility machine may be a better option.

## Pay Attention to the RTP

The Return to Player (RTP) is the percentage of all money wagered on a machine that is paid back to players over time. Machines with a higher RTP tend to pay out more frequently than machines with a lower RTP. Look for machines with an RTP of 95% or higher for the best chances of winning.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, while there is no way to predict when a video slot machine is ready to hit, there are some strategies and tips that can help you increase your chances of winning. Look for signs of recent payouts, consider the volatility of the machine, and pay attention to the RTP. Remember to gamble responsibly and have fun playing video slot machines on 888 Casino.
