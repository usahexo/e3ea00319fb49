#  Vancouver Canucks End Toronto Maple Leafs' Unbeaten Streak

The Vancouver Canucks dealt the Toronto Maple Leafs their first loss in regulation this season with a 3-2 victory on Thursday night.

Jacob Markstrom made 36 saves for the Canucks, who had lost their previous two games. Sven Baertschi, Bo Horvat and Brock Boeser scored for Vancouver.

"This was an important game for us," said Canucks coach Travis Green. "We needed it."

Morgan Rielly and Patrick Marleau scored for the Maple Leafs, who were playing their third game in four nights. Frederik Andersen made 27 saves.

"You can't win every game in this league," said Andersen. "They played well and we just have to learn from it and move on."

#  Edmonton Oilers Overcome Minnesota Wild in Overtime

The Edmonton Oilers were locked in a battle against the Minnesota Wild on Thursday night. The game was a physical one, with both teams getting chances to score. In the end, it was the Oilers who prevailed in overtime, thanks to a goal by Ryan Nugent-Hopkins.

This was an important win for the Oilers, who are now just one point behind the Calgary Flames for first place in the Pacific Division. The Wild are a tough opponent, and it was clear from the start that this would not be an easy game for Edmonton.

Connor McDavid led the way for the Oilers, scoring two goals in the contest. He has been on fire lately, and is proving why he is one of the best players in the NHL. His teammates will need to continue stepping up if they want to keep pace with Calgary.

Oscar Klefbom also scored for Edmonton, while Mikko Koskinen had a solid outing between the pipes, making 29 saves on 31 shots. This was an important win for him as well, as he looks to establish himself as the team's number-one goalie heading into the playoffs.

The Oilers will next face off against the Winnipeg Jets on Saturday night. This should be another tough test for Edmonton, but they appear to be up for the challenge.

#  Carolina Hurricanes Surge Past Washington Capitals

The Carolina Hurricanes cruised to an emphatic 5-2 victory over the Washington Capitals on Wednesday night, with Forsberg, Slavin and Aho leading the way offensively.

Forsberg got things started early for Carolina with a goal just 1:48 into the game, with Slavin and Aho also scoring in the first period to give the Hurricanes a 3-0 lead heading into the intermission.

Washington finally got on the scoreboard midway through the second period, but Sebastian Aho effectively put the game out of reach late in the frame with his second goal of the night.

Jeff Skinner added an insurance marker early in the third period to make it 5-1 before Washington added another goal late in garbage time.

With Wednesday’s win, Carolina has now won four of their last five games and sits just one point back of Columbus for third place in the Metropolitan Division.
