#  Learn How to Play 888 Guess Roulette and Cash Away!

Have you ever played chance games? If so, you would have a fair idea of how 888 guess roulette works. This game is based on the premise that players make wagers on where they think the ball will land after it is dropped onto the spinning wheel. As the name suggests, 888 guess roulette offers players a chance to win big payouts from as little as €0.10 up to €100 per bet.

First time players might be daunted by all the betting options available, but don’t worry – we’re here to show you how to play 888 guess roulette like a pro!

To get started, choose your chip value and place your bets on the red or black numbers, odd or even numbers, high (19-36) or low (1-18) numbers, or any of the other combinations on the table. If you’re feeling lucky, you could also place a bet on splits (two adjoining numbers), streets (three numbers in a row), or corners (four adjoining numbers).

When all bets are placed, the croupier will spin the wheel and drop the ball into its slot. The ball will then travel around the edge of the wheel before slowing down and dropping into one of 37 coloured pockets. The payout for each bet depends on the probability of that particular outcome occurring. So, if you bet on black and the ball lands in a black pocket, you will receive your original stake back plus another 18 chips (€18 in total).

If you fancy giving 888 guess roulette a go for yourself, we recommend registering at one of our partner casinos such as Betfred Casino. Not only can you enjoy some great bonuses when signing up, but you can also practise playing free demo games before placing any real money bets.

#  Play Like a Pro: Tips for Winning at 888 Guess Roulette

There’s a lot of excitement that comes with playing in a casino, and one of the most popular games is roulette. Roulette can be enjoyed by players of all levels of experience, and at 888 guess roulette, there are some tips that can help you play like a pro and increase your chances of winning.

In order to play like a pro at 888 guess roulette, it’s important to understand the basics of the game. The objective of roulette is to correctly predict where the ball will land after spinning around the wheel. There are 36 possible outcomes, which are represented by numbers 1-36. In addition, there are two special symbols – 0 and 00 – which represent the house edge.

The odds of any particular number being chosen are equally likely, so your chances of winning are 1 in 36. However, there are a number of bets that you can make which offer different odds and payout potentials. The most common bet is on a single number, which pays out 35:1 if you win.

There are also several bets that payout when two or more numbers are hit. The most common is called a “street” bet, which pays out 11:1 if you hit three numbers in a row. You can also place bets on four or six numbers at once by betting on adjacent squares on the grid layout of the table.

Of course, as with any casino game, it’s important to be aware of the house edge and how it affects your chances of winning. In roulette, the house edge averages at 2.7%. This means that for every dollar you bet, you can expect to lose 2.7 cents on average. So it’s important to always bet within your budget and not chase losses.

Now that you know the basics of how to play 888 guess roulette like a pro, here are some tips to help improve your chances of winning:

#1 Don’t Bet on Red or Black

The vast majority of players make this mistake – betting on red or black thinking that they have an equal chance because there are eighteen possibilities in total. However, this isn’t actually true because there’s only one green zero slot on the wheel which increases the house odds from 18:1 to 37:1 when betting on either red or black. If you want to minimise the house edge as much as possible, avoid making this type of bet altogether.

#  Beat the House Edge at 888 Guess Roulette with These Simple Tips

888 Guess Roulette is one of the easiest casino games to beat the house edge at. All you have to do is use these simple tips to improve your chances of winning.

Tip 1: Play European Roulette

The house edge is lower for European Roulette than for American Roulette. So by playing European Roulette, you can improve your chances of winning.

Tip 2: Bet on Single Numbers

If you bet on a single number, the house edge is only 2.7%. This gives you a better chance of winning than if you bet on a range of numbers.

Tip 3: Use Systems Bets

System bets offer high payouts, but the odds are still in favour of the house. However, by using systems bets you can minimise the risk and maximise your potential profits.

Tip 4: Avoid Neighbour Bets

Neighbour bets offer low payouts and high odds, which means they are not favourable for players. It is better to avoid these bets and instead focus on more profitable options.
