#  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Other Major Banks Allow Online Gambling

In a landmark decision, the Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and other leading American banks announced they will start allowing online gambling transactions. The move comes as a major shift in policy for big banks and is seen as a sign of growing acceptance of gambling in the US.

Online gambling has been illegal in the US since 2006, when then-President George W. Bush signed into law the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA). The law prohibits financial institutions from processing payments to online casinos and other gambling sites.

However, the prohibition has done little to stop Americans from gambling online. A 2017 study by research firm Frost & Sullivan found that about $4.5 billion was wagered on sports betting websites in the US in 2016, up from $3.8 billion in 2015.

The new policy by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase is seen as an attempt to get ahead of potential regulations that could legalize online gambling in the US. Several states, including New Jersey, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, are considering legalizing online gambling in order to generate revenue for their budgets.

“We have been working on this for some time and it’s just something we believe is the right thing to do for our customers,” said Goldman Sachs spokesperson Andrea Raphael.

The change in policy by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase is also being seen as a way to attract more customers at a time when traditional banking products are becoming less popular. In a recent survey by BankingMyWay, only 31% of millennials said they were extremely or very likely to use a traditional bank account in the next year.

Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are not the only banks getting into the online gambling business. Bank of America announced earlier this month that it would start allowing customers in Nevada to deposit money into their accounts directly from their casino accounts without having to go through a middleman.

#  American Banks Finally Allow Online Gambling

After years of lobbying and court challenges from the banking industry, the Department of Justice announced Thursday that it would no longer prosecute banks for processing payments for online gambling websites.

The move opens up the American market for online gambling, which is currently worth an estimated $150 billion a year. While some states, such as Nevada and New Jersey, have legalized online gambling, most of the country has been unable to participate in the market because of the federal prohibition.

Now that banks will be able to process payments for online gambling websites without fear of prosecution, industry analysts expect the market to grow significantly. In addition to casinos and poker rooms, experts say that the market will likely see a surge in interest in fantasy sports and other forms of online betting.

Gambling proponents have hailed the decision as a victory for freedom and consumer choice. "This is great news for Americans who want to gamble responsibly online," said John Pappas, executive director of the Poker Players Alliance. "The Department of Justice's new policy respects the rights of individuals to make their own decisions about whether and how to gamble."

Online gambling opponents express concern that the decision could lead to greater addiction and social problems. "This is a very dangerous step," said Timothy Fong, co-director of the UCLA Gambling Studies Program. "Allowing easy access to online gambling will only lead to more people getting addicted and losing money."

Despite these concerns, most analysts believe that the decision will benefit both consumers and the economy as a whole. "This is a very positive development," said Robert Williams Jr., a gaming law expert at Washington University in St. Louis. "It will create jobs and generate tax revenue for states that decide to legalize online gambling."

American banks have long been reluctant to process payments for online gambling websites because of fears of prosecution from the Department of Justice. This hesitance has led many players to use overseas sites that are less reputable and offer fewer protections than those in America. With Thursday's announcement, however, this may soon change.

# Deposit Now and Play Instantly at Your Favorite Casino

There are many benefits of playing casino games online, the first and most obvious being that you can do it from the comfort of your own home. You don’t have to dress up, put on makeup, or go out in public; you can simply sit in your pajamas, fire up your computer or mobile device, and start playing.

Another big benefit is that many online casinos offer sign-up bonuses to new players, which can give you a lot of extra cash to play with. Combine this with the convenience and privacy of playing from home, and you can see why so many people prefer to play online.

One thing to watch out for, however, is that not all online casinos are created equal. Some are reputable and honest operations, while others are scams that will try to take your money and run. So how do you know which casinos are safe to play at?

One good way is to look for casinos that have been approved by independent watchdog groups like eCOGRA (eCommerce and Online Gaming Regulation and Assurance). These groups audit casino sites to make sure they meet certain safety and fairness standards. They also publish reports on their findings so that players can make informed choices about where they want to play.

If you’re looking for a safe and reliable online casino to play at, then we recommend checking out CasinoEuro. They’ve been around since 2002, are licensed and regulated by the Malta Gaming Authority, and have received eCOGRA’s prestigious “Safe & Fair” seal of approval. So if you’re looking for a hassle-free gaming experience, then CasinoEuro is a great option.

# 3. Wells Fargo & Co. Joins the Ranks of Banks Allowing Online Gambling

The first U.S. bank to offer online gambling services is Wells Fargo & Co., who on July 31st, 2015 joined the ranks of other major banks allowing their customers to gamble online. Wells Fargo has long been one of the most popular banks in the United States, and their decision to offer online gambling is likely to bolster their customer base even further.

For years, major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America have allowed their customers to gamble online through partnerships with companies like PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker. However, Wells Fargo was noticeably absent from this list, until now. This move is likely due to the surge in popularity of online gambling in recent years; according to a report by the American Gaming Association (AGA), online gambling revenues reached $4.5 billion in 2014, a figure that is expected to grow in the years ahead.

"Our goal is to provide our customers with products and services that meet their needs," said Phyllis Campbell, head of Wells Fargo's Pacific Northwest region. "Our decision to offer our customers access to regulated online gambling sites provides them with another convenient way to engage in this activity while ensuring they have access to high-quality sites."

Wells Fargo's entrance into the online gambling market is good news for both consumers and operators alike. For consumers, it means more choice and competition, which should lead to better products and services. And for operators, it signals that the banking industry is starting to come around on online gambling, which should lead to increased investment and innovation in the space.

So far, reaction to Wells Fargo's move has been positive. "This is a watershed event for the industry," said Iddo Gilron, CEO of Playtech US, a provider of software and services for the regulated U.S. gaming market."It proves that banks are starting to fully recognize the potential of regulated igaming as an important growth engine for economies around the world."

Time will tell if other banks follow Wells Fargo's lead in offering online gambling services, but for now it looks like things are headed in the right direction.

# 4. Bank of America Extends Reach into Online Gaming Industry

Bank of America has announced its plans to enter the online gaming industry, through the acquisition of GameStop’s advertising division. This move could put Bank of America in direct competition with other online gaming giants, such as Amazon and Google.

According to Reuters, the deal is worth $1.2 billion, and is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. The advertising division being acquired by Bank of America is known as Geeknet, which operates brands such as ThinkGeek and Hot Topic.

Bank of America has not released any statements yet on how it plans to use Geeknet’s advertising capabilities within the online gaming industry. However, it can be assumed that they will be used to promote Bank of America’s own online gaming platforms, as well as those of its competitors.

This move by Bank of America comes at a time when the global market for online gaming is expected to reach $91.5 billion by 2020. This presents a huge opportunity for Bank of America to gain a foothold in the industry, and could help them compete with the likes of Amazon and Google.

# 5. Citigroup Widens Net to Include Online Gambling

In what seems to be a never-ending battle against restricting and outright banning Online Gambling, Citigroup announced that it will now allow the transactions in states where it is legal.

In their statement, they said: "We serve more than 100 million customers in the U.S. and our goal is to provide them with products and services that meet their needs."

The news was met with mixed reactions by the industry insiders, with some praising the move as a step in the right direction, while others feel that this could just be a way for Citigroup to avoid any potential backlash by not openly supporting gambling.
