#  How did the Detroit Lions get their name?

The Detroit Lions were founded in Portsmouth, Ohio in 1929. At first they were known as the Portsmouth Spartans, but they would eventually relocate to Detroit, Michigan and become the Detroit Lions. So how did they get their name?

There are a few popular theories floating around. One is that the team was originally named after General Motors, which was based in Detroit. Another theory is that the team was named after the Lions Football Club, which was also located in Detroit. The most likely explanation, however, is that the team was simply named after the city of Detroit itself.

Since the team is located in Detroit and has such a strong connection to the city, it seems only fitting that they would be named after it. The Detroit Lions have been an important part of Detroit's history and culture for many years, and they continue to be one of the most popular teams in the NFL.

#  Who was the first head coach of the Detroit Lions?

The Detroit Lions were first coached by Dutch Dykes in 1934.

#  Who is the current owner of the Detroit Lions?

Owner of the Detroit Lions is Martha Firestone Ford.
