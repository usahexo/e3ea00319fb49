#  Proper blackjack speed load Brasileiro Serie A technique for optimal results 

In any casino game, the house has a distinct advantage. In blackjack, this edge is about 1 percent, which means the casino can be expected to make a profit on average of $1 per every $100 wagered. The goal of the player is to overcome the house edge by playing skillfully and minimizing mistakes.

One way to minimize mistakes and speed up the game is by using a technique called "speed loading." This involves quickly stacking and unstacking chips to keep the game moving. It's important to note that speed loading should not be used with small stacks of chips. The purpose of speed loading is to save time when betting large amounts, so it's most effective when playing with stacks of $25 or more.

Here's how you do it: 

1) Start by putting one chip in front of you. This will be your anchor chip. 
2) Stack the remaining chips in front of you in a pyramid shape, with the anchor chip on top. 
3) When it's time to bet, take the pyramid apart and place one chip at a time on the table, starting with the anchor chip. 
4) If you lose, reset the pyramid and start over. If you win, keep the chips in front of you and add them to your existing stack.

This technique allows you to place bets very quickly without having to fumble around with individual chips. It also eliminates the need to count out chips for each bet, which can slow down the game. With practice, you can become proficient at speed loading and give yourself a competitive edge against the casino.
