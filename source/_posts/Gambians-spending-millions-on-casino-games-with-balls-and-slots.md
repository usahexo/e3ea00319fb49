#  Gambians spending millions on casino games with balls and slots

A lot of money changes hands in the Gambian casino industry. The country’s three casinos – the Regency, the Atlantic and the Batelay – each take in millions of dollars annually. The money is gambled away on games of chance like roulette, blackjack and slot machines.

While it is not clear how much of this money comes from locals, it is known that a good number of foreigners also visit the casinos in search of easy riches. In fact, some high-profile foreign gamblers have been known to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in a single sitting at one of the casinos.

Interestingly, most Gambians who gamble at the casinos do not seem to be winning. This was confirmed by a study commissioned by the Central Bank in 2016 which found that only about 37 percent of casino gamblers were making profits. The rest were either breaking even or losing money.

So why do Gambians continue to flock to the casinos despite their poor odds? One reason could be that they see gambling as a way to make quick and easy money. And with so many casinos in the country, it’s easy for them to find one that offers them a game they can win.

Another possible reason is that some Gambians see gambling as a way to forget their troubles. They may be going through tough times financially or emotionally, and they see gambling as a way to escape their problems for a while.

Whatever the reason, it is clear that Gambians are spending millions of dollars on casino games every year. This is not good news for a country that is already struggling with high levels of poverty and unemployment.

#  Gambian authorities concerned about increasing casino activity with balls and slots 

In Gambia, the Ministry of Justice and Interior is concerned about the increased casino activity with balls and slots. The ministry has issued a statement calling on casino operators to stop the game or face prosecution.

"Such games are prohibited by law. Operators of these casinos must stop this unabated act now, before it gets out of hand. The ministry would not hesitate to prosecute any individual or group caught operating these games," the statement said.

The ministry's warning comes amid concerns that some people are losing large sums of money in the casinos. Some people have even lost their homes as a result of gambling debts.

It is not clear how many casinos are currently operating in Gambia, but they are said to be spread across the country. Most of them are located in hotel lobbies and other public places.

Gambian officials say they are not opposed to gambling per se, but want to ensure that it is done in a responsible manner.

#  Casino gambling with balls and slots becoming a popular pastime in Gambia

Casino gambling, with both balls and slots machines, is becoming a popular pastime in Gambia. Gambling has long been a favored activity in the country, but it has traditionally been confined to betting on horses or playing cards.

Now there are casinos all over the country, with new ones popping up all the time. The government has even gotten into the act, building a casino in Banjul as part of a new luxury hotel development.

The catalyst for the explosion in Gambian casino gambling appears to be the influx of Chinese investors and tourists. The Chinese are avid gamblers, and they have been enthusiastically embraced by Gambian casinos.

There are now several casinos catering specifically to Chinese players, with special ball and slot machines that are popular in China. They offer high limits and often have VIP rooms where wealthy Chinese players can gamble away their fortunes.

While there are some Gambians who oppose the growth of casino gambling, arguing that it is leading to an increase in problem gambling, most people seem to see it as a harmless diversion.

With its beautiful beaches and lush tropical landscape, Gambia is an ideal place for a bit of casino gambling relaxation. So why not give it a try?

#  Gambians turning to casino games with balls and slots amid economic crisis

† Gambians, who have long relied on tourism as their key source of income, are increasingly turning to casino games in an attempt to make money amid the country’s ongoing economic crisis.

† According to reports, many people are now spending time at the country’s three casinos – The Princess, The Maestro and The Senegambia – in a bid to win back what they have lost.

† “The casino is a place where you can forget your troubles and enjoy yourself,” said one Gambian. “It is a form of entertainment for us.”

† Another Gambian said that he had been going to the casino four or five times a week since last year in order to try and make some money.

† Gambling is illegal in Gambia, but authorities have turned a blind eye to the casinos as they provide much-needed revenue.

† The economic crisis has hit Gambia hard, with high levels of unemployment and an ever-growing public debt. In January this year, the government announced it was introducing austerity measures in order to try and get the economy back on track.
