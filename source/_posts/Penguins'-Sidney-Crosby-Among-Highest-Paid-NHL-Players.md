In the 2016-2017 season, the 10 highest paid NHL players earned a combined $156.7 million in salary. This means that the average salary for an NHL player in the 2016-2017 season was $2.9 million, but the median salary was much lower at $1 million.

Most NHL teams use a salary cap to limit how much they can spend on player salaries. The current salary cap for the NHL is set at $75 million, which means that no team can exceed this amount when signing players. This cap helps to ensure that teams with less money are able to compete with teams that have more money.

NHL rookie contracts are typically four years long and worth between $1 and $4 million per year. Veteran contracts are typically three or four years long and worth more money per year than rookie contracts. Many players also sign bonuses as part of their contracts, which are paid out either annually or when certain goals are met.

Players’ salaries are often renegotiated after they have finished their rookie contract or played a certain number of years in the league. This allows teams to keep their top players while also ensuring that they don’t go over the salary cap.

The current highest paid player in the NHL is Connor McDavid of the Edmonton Oilers, who is earning an annual salary of $12.5 million as part of a eight-year contract he signed in July 2017.
