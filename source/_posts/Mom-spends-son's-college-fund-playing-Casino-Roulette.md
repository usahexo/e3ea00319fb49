#  Mom spends son's college fund playing Casino Roulette

A mom in Maryland has admitted she gambled away her son's college fund at a casino.

Patricia Todak, 57, said she lost around $90,000 playing Casino Roulette over the course of two years. She blamed her actions on a gambling addiction and said she regrets what she did.

Todak said she used the money from her son's college fund as well as some money from her own savings to gamble at the casino. She also took out loans to continue playing.

"I'm so ashamed of myself," Todak told The Baltimore Sun. "I worked so hard for that money."

She said she started gambling after her husband died in 2015. Todak said she was struggling to cope with his death and looked to gambling as a way to escape her problems.

She now says she is getting help for her addiction and is working to repay the money she owes. Her son is still in college and Todak says she is trying to find ways to make up for the money she lost.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for those affected by it. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, seek help immediately.

#  Casino Roulette leaves family homeless

Angelo and his wife, Maria, were left homeless after playing casino roulette. After spending all their money on the game, they had nothing left to pay their rent. They were soon forced to move out of their apartment and live on the streets.

Roulette is a very risky game that can lead to serious financial problems for players. Angelo and Maria should have known better than to gamble away their entire savings on such a risky venture.

There are many other games available at casinos that are less risky and can still provide players with a thrill. Slot machines, for example, are much less risky and can still provide players with the opportunity to win big prizes.

If Angelo and Maria had played slots instead of roulette, they would likely still be living in their apartment and would not be experiencing the hardships of being homeless.

#  Couple gambles away their life savings on Casino Roulette

John and Karen were your typical young couple in their early twenties. They had just graduated from college and were starting their lives together. John had landed a great job as a software engineer and was making good money. Karen was a stay at home mom, taking care of their one year old daughter.

John and Karen loved to gamble, and they especially loved playing Casino Roulette. They had read that the odds of winning at Roulette were better than any other casino game, so they decided to risk their life savings on it. Over the course of a few months, they lost all of their money playing Roulette.

They were forced to sell their house and move into a small apartment. They had to get rid of all their possessions and go into debt just to make ends meet. The only thing they had left was their daughter.

John and Karen eventually divorced, partly because of the financial stress that gambling had put on their marriage. John moved out of state and Karen moved in with her parents. They both still regret gambling away their life savings on Casino Roulette.

My addiction caused me to make some terrible decisions. I would spend hours at the casino, often losing all night long. In the end, I lost everything I had and was left with nothing.

I know that if I hadn't been addicted to gambling, I would have never lost everything that I had. My addiction was the root of my downfall. If you're struggling with a gambling addiction, please get help before it's too late.
