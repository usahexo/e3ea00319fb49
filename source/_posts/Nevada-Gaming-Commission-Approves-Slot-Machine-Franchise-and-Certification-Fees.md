#  Nevada Gaming Commission Approves Slot Machine Franchise and Certification Fees

The Nevada Gaming Commission (NGC) unanimously approved changes to the regulations for slot machine licensees at its meeting today. The most notable change is the increase in the fees for slot machine licenses and certification.

The fee for a new slot machine license will be raised from $5,000 to $10,000. The renewal fee for an existing license will also be increased from $2,500 to $5,000. In addition, the NGC will charge a new fee of $1,000 for each slot machine that is certified.

Commissioner Deborah Cunningham said that the fees were necessary to offset the cost of regulating the industry. She noted that the NGC had not raised its fees since 2004 and that costs had increased significantly over that time.

Slot machine operators voiced their support for the fee increases. One operator said that it was important to maintain a level playing field among casinos and that the higher fees would help to do just that.

The new fees will take effect on January 1, 2018.

#  $5 Million Raised In Slot Machine Franchise and Certification Fees

_Las Vegas, Nevada_ - Slot machine operators and manufacturers from around the world convened at the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas this week to discuss the future of their industry. In a major development, it was announced that $5 million had been raised in franchise and certification fees.

"The industry is booming," said conference organizer John Smith. "We're seeing more and more people interested in getting into the business."

The high cost of entry is seen as a major barrier to entry, but also as a sign of the industry's strength.

"This shows that there is a lot of interest in our products," said conference attendee Amir Khan. "It's good for everyone involved."

The money will be used to fund the development of new slot machines and to help operators get certified. The certification process is seen as critical to the success of the industry.

"In order to make sure that we're providing a quality experience for our customers, we need to make sure that all our operators are certified," said Smith. "This money will help us do that."

#  Indiana Casino Slots Owners to Pay $2.5 Million in Fees

Indiana casino slots owners are going to have to pay a big sum of money this year. The $2.5 million in fees that they will have to fork over is the highest amount that has ever been paid in the state.

This news comes as the Indiana Gaming Commission outlined its annual budget for the year. Along with the casino slots owners, racetrack owners will also have to pay a significant sum this year.

Racetrack owners must pay $1.5 million, which is up from the $1 million that they were required to pay last year. This increase can be largely attributed to the new live dealers table games that have been introduced at some of the racetracks in the state.

The Indiana Gaming Commission stated that the additional money is necessary in order to cover the increasing costs of regulation. In addition, it was noted that a portion of the money will be used to help fund problem gambling programs in the state.

When asked about these increases, Jay Steinictis, who owns two casinos in Indiana, had this to say: “It’s just another cost of doing business. We knew it was coming and we planned for it.”

Other casino operators echoed Steinictis’ sentiments, with most stating that they had expected these fee increases and had factored them into their business plans accordingly.

#  Michigan Authorizes Slot Machine Franchise Fee

Michigan has authorized a slot machine franchise fee of $200 for each machine. This new fee will be used to help fund state police operations.

This is the first time that Michigan has charged a fee for slot machines. The previous fee was a flat $100 per machine, but this new fee will generate an estimated $9 million in additional revenue for the state.

The new fee went into effect on January 1, 2019. Operators who have more than 50 machines must pay the fee, and it is based on the number of machines at each location.

Governor Rick Snyder said that the fee is needed to help fund state police operations. The state police have seen their budget cut by $25 million in recent years, and the new fee will help offset some of those cuts.

Slot machine operators are not happy with the new fee, but they understand that it is necessary to help fund state police operations.

#  Officials: Franchise Fee Helps Fund Regulation of Gambling

Casino officials say that the new $500 million franchise fee assessed on the gambling industry will help fund the state’s regulatory efforts. The money will be used to hire more state officials to police gambling and help protect consumers, they said.

The news comes as a relief to casino operators who have been pushing for an increase in regulation of the industry in light of expanding gambling options. The new fee is in addition to the current $10 million licensing fee charged to casinos.

"This is something that the casino industry has been advocating for quite some time," said Dennis Gomes, president of Resorts Casino Hotel and a member of the state Gaming Commission. "We need to make sure that we have properly funded regulators so that we can maintain the high level of integrity that is expected in this industry."

Gomes noted that with Internet gambling becoming increasingly popular, it was important to make sure that there were enough people monitoring activities such as player verification and fraud prevention.

State officials said that the new fee would also help them crack down on illegal gambling operations. In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of underground casinos, sometimes known as "wire houses." These unlicensed casinos often operate without any oversight or regulation, leaving players at risk of being scammed or cheated.

"This new fee will give us additional resources to shut down these illegal operations and protect consumers," said Edward Klasko, chief counsel for the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. "We are committed to making sure that everyone who gambles in this state does so safely and responsibly."
