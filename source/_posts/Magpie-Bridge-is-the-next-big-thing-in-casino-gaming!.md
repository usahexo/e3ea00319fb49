If you're looking for a fun, new game to play with your family or friends, you should check out Magpie Bridge! This card game is easy to learn but provides plenty of challenge and excitement.

Magpie Bridge is a trick-taking game for four players. The deck consists of 52 cards, including two jokers. Each player is dealt thirteen cards. The object of the game is to score the most points by winning as many tricks as possible.

The player who leads the first trick is determined by the rank of the card played. The highest card played in a particular suit takes precedence over lower cards. If two identical high cards are played, the second card played takes precedence (e.g., if an Ace and King are played, the Ace would take precedence). If there's still no clear winner, the player who holds the highest trump card wins the trick.

Players must follow suit if they can, but they are not required to trump if they cannot follow suit. The player who wins the trick collects all of the cards and sets them aside. The player who wins the majority of tricks (at least six) during a round wins that round. The first player to win two rounds wins the game.
